# Security Project

#### This repository contains all the notes and sample codes used in my presentation for the Security class for International Hellenic University.

##### This repo will be updated as the project continues. The goal of this project is to create a FUD payload if possible by leveraging certain antivirus and firewall bypassing techniques and see how efficient they are.

## This project is for educational purposes only! 
I will not take any responsibility for any illegal usage of the sample codes or final payload.

### The first presentation consists of basic malware types from the ethical point of view. 
1) Is the code really malicious on it's own or is it the intended usage of the code that marks it malicious?
2) What are the types of malware out there.
3) A real life example of forensics and malware analysis (Not dangerous)
4) Sample codes of custom sandboxed malware. (Virus, keylogger, Remote Access Tool / Backdoor, Ransomware)

### The second presentation explains what a shell is, the differences between bind and reverse shells and some more advanced shells like meterpreter.
1) What is a shell
2) What is a Bind Shell and what is a Reverse Shell
3) What are the differences between Bind Shells and Reverse Shells
4) When to use each
5) What is a meterpreter shell and what are it's capabilities.
#### There is a workshop after the presentation on how the meterpreter works. We will be testing it on an attack scenario and install it on an android device.

### The third presentation defines what a firewall is and presents the most common firewall types out there.
1) What is a firewall
2) How does a firewall work
3) Packet Filtering Firewalls
4) NGFW Firewalls
5) WAF or Proxy Firewalls
6) NAT Firewalls
7) SMLI Firewalls
8) UTM Firewalls
9) Cloud Firewalls
10) Threat Focused Firewalls
11) Circuit Level Firewalls
