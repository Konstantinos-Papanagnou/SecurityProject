# Security Project

#### This repository contains all the notes and sample codes used for my presentation on the Security class for International Hellenic University.

##### This repo will be updated as the project continues. The goal of this project is to create a FUD payload if possible by leveraging certain antivirus and firewall bypassing techniques and see how efficient they are.

## This project is for educational purposes only! 
I will not take any responsibility for any illegal usage of the sample codes or final payload.

### The first presentation consists of basic malware types from the ethical point of view. 
1) Is the code really malicious on it's own or is it the intended usage of the code that marks it malicious?
2) What are the types of malware out there.
3) A real life example of forensics and malware analysis (Not dangerous)
4) Sample codes of custom sandboxed malware. (Virus, keylogger, Remote Access Tool / Backdoor, Ransomware)
